## Screen

[GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window and keeps processes running even if your connection drops, making it useful running remote jobs.

### Options

```
screen -S [name]   # Start new named session
screen -ls         # List sessions
screen -r [name]   # Reattach to session
screen -d -r       # Detach existing and reattach here
```

### Shortcut keys

```
Ctrl-a + c       # Create new window
Ctrl-a + "       # List/select windows
Ctrl-a + n/p     # Next/previous window
Ctrl-a + d       # Detach session
Ctrl-a + k       # Kill window
Ctrl-a + S       # Split horizontal
Ctrl-a + |       # Split vertical 
Ctrl-a + <TAB>   # Switch split regions
Ctrl-a + X       # Close active split
```

### Shortcut keys

```txt
Ctrl-a + c        # Create a new window.
Ctrl-a + "        # Window selector
Ctrl-a + w        # Displays the list of all the windows currently opened.
Ctrl-a + A        # Renames the current windows. The name will appear when you will list the list of windows opened with Ctrl-a + w.
