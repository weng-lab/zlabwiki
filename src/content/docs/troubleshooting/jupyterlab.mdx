Troubleshooting for common issues with Jupyterlab

## Deleting files

If you are experiencing issues deleting files form the Jupyterlab IDE here is how you go about fixing it.

First you need to find your Jupyter config file. It will most likely be located at `/home/USERNAME/.jupyter`. 

`cd` into that directory:

```bash
cd /home/$(whoami)/.jupyter
```

`ls` and look for the file named `jupyter_server_config.py`. If you do not see the file,
run:

```bash
jupyter server --generate-config
```

Now edit the `jupyter_server_config.py`:

```bash
EDITOR jupyter_server_config.py
```

Look for the config option `c.FileContentsManager.delete_to_trash`. If it is set to `True`, change it to `False`. 

Now you should be able to delete files in Jupyterlab. 👍
